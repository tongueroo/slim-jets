# Slim Jets

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/slim-jets.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/slim-jets)

[Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) is a template language whose goal is to reduce the syntax to the essential parts without becoming cryptic.

This gem adds Slim support to [Jets: The Ruby Serverless Framework](http://rubyonjets.com/).

Looking for someone who is interested in maintaining this gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jets project Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'slim-jets'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
